# Little Soup Project

This project is aimed at creating a light-weight clone of the Beautiful Soup library. The littlesoup package parses html similar to Beautiful Soup's 'html.parser' with the added benefit of being smaller and faster.

However, this package is experimental; therefore, it is not advised to use it in big projects. Nevertheless, you can feel free to integrate it into any small project of yours. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

To use the package, simply clone this repository and copy the littlesoup package/folder into your project folder. To read the documentation on how to use it, go here: [Documentation](https://github.com/Oracking/littlesoup_project/tree/master/littlesoup)

If you are interested in building this parser yourself, you can check out this tutorial which will guide you through building your own Little Soup:
